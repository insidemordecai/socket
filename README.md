## sockets

this shows how sockets work in networking 
- the server side
- and the client side

i've made use of Java in this example with two different classes (files).

for this to work, run the server file followed by the client file.
if you run this vice versa, the code will throw error files since the server opens the specified port which the client connects to. 

observe the console to see how it works and you can of course modify it to how you wish.
